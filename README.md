# Software Engineering Fundamentals Project

**System Overview**

The HomeWoW web app is a comprehensive property management platform
designed to enhance the user experience through a robust verification system.
Ensuring the integrity of the rental process, the system implements a thorough
verification mechanism, confirming the legitimacy of property owners and
agents by validating their submitted property documents. This feature instills
trust and confidence in users seeking rental properties. The platform caters to
diverse rental needs by accommodating both short and long-term tenancies,
offering flexibility to users based on their preferences. A key functionality of
the system is the provision of a seamless Tenancy Agreement feature,
allowing property owners and tenants to create, review, and sign agreements
efficiently. This makes a more efficient rental process, minimizing paperwork
and ensuring a secure promised foundation for both parties. Additionally, the
system prioritizes transparency by providing accurate and up-to-date market
prices, empowering users to make informed decisions. Altogether this
revolutionizes the property rental landscape by prioritizing security, flexibility,
efficiency, and transparency for property owners, agents, and tenants.
